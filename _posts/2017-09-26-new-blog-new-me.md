This is the obligatory "new blog, new me" post. A message for absolutely nobody
- because who is really going to be reading this bumbling rubbish anyway?

I got a neat looking Jekyll theme from the Internet. It's pretty plain, simple and
boring, which is quite fitting really. Next time I change this I might choose to
just write stuff down, scan it, and upload images, because it's probably easier than
getting Jekyll themes set up. Then again, I am a little bit simple. YMMV.

The layout makes it look like I don't blog much (my schedule is just so busy these days /s), 
so I'm going to leave the default posts in place until I can fill the page a bit 
more. Might even throw up some Lorem Ipsum posts in the meantime to pad it out
more.

You can look forward to another post in the next few years. But, don't hold your
breath.
